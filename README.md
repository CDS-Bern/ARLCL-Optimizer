ARLCL-Optimizer is an application implementing the cooperative localization method ARLCL: Anchor-free Ranging-Likelihood-based Cooperative Localization. This method has been developed by the Communication and Distributed Systems research group at the University of Bern.

The application supports both Graphical (for single scenario executions) and Headless (for batch executions) modes.

*Supported Models:*
<br />
- RSS-based ranging using Bluetooth Low Energy signals [BLE] (model's units are in meters)
- Time-based ranging using Ultra-Wideband signals [UWB] (model's units are in centimeters)

## Ranging Database

Depending on the execution mode, two different types of files can be used. GUI mode makes use of single database files (.rss or .smpl) containing the ranging measurements for a specific scenario. Headless mode makes use of an additional index file containing the scenario names of multiple database files.

This repo provides sample databases and index files (see Examples).
The complete databases used for the evaluation of ARLCL are also openly available:

For the creation of new database files and to support the resulted localization performance, the structure of a database file needs to be specific and contain a) for each node, the positions' ground truth and b) for each pair, the ranging measurement (dBm/time) used by arlcl and the distance measurement (cm) used by the baselines.

## Headless mode

For batch execution (with results per cycle), the application may be launched in a scripted manner by executing the jar in headless mode and passing the selected parameters.
The user needs to configure and call sequentially the provided batch-run.bat, or use directly the CLI according to the following example:

`$ java -jar "arlcl-optimizer.jar" out_path="Export" db_path="Examples/BLE-RSS_Evaluation-Samples_Lecture-Room (Examples)/DB" batch_path="Examples/BLE-RSS_Evaluation-Samples_Lecture-Room (Examples)/Batch.txt" model=ble contours=30 min_m=95 kn=6 pos_extent=10 seed=0 end_iter=100 threads=1 opt_iter=1000 max_t=1000000 f_tol=1e-2 step=100 cycles=50`
