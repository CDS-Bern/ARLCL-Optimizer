ARLCL-Optimizer is an application implementing the cooperative localization method ARLCL: Anchor-free Ranging-Likelihood-based Cooperative Localization. This method has been developed by the Communication and Distributed Systems research group at the University of Bern.

The application supports both Graphical (for single scenario executions) and Headless (for batch executions) modes.

## Ranging Database

Depending on the execution mode, two different types of files can be used. GUI mode makes use of single database files (.rss or .smpl) containing the ranging measurements for a specific scenario. Headless mode makes use of an additional index file containing the scenario names of multiple database files.

This repo provides sample databases and index files (see Examples).
The complete databases used for the evaluation of ARLCL are also openly available:

For the creation of new database files and to support the resulted localization performance, the structure of a database file needs to be specific and contain a) for each node, the positions' ground truth and b) for each pair, the ranging measurement (dBm/time) used by arlcl and the distance measurement (cm) used by the baselines.

An index file contains (per line) a scenario name available in the following in a database file, in the following format:

    T (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21) 20
    T (4,5,6) 1 
    ...

## GUI mode
- Executes a cooperative localization optimization for the selected database of ranging measurements.

The application may start by executing the provided run.bat or from CLI using

`$ java --add-exports java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.desktop/sun.java2d=ALL-UNNAMED -jar path\to\arlcl-optimizer.jar`

In both cases one needs to set the correct "path\to\arlcl-optimizer.jar"

----

# CL based on Mass Spring
